# Acoustic Streaming in a Microchannel Cross Section ‚öôÔ∏è

This project investigates **acoustic streaming**, a nonlinear phenomenon that generates a steady fluid flow due to the viscous dissipation of acoustic waves. The study focuses on modeling and analyzing acoustic streaming in a **two-dimensional microchannel cross section**. Using both **analytical theory** and **numerical simulations with COMSOL Multiphysics**, the project explores the generation of streaming rolls, temperature gradients, and particle transport.

The results demonstrate how these microscale effects can be leveraged for **particle manipulation** in lab-on-a-chip and **biomedical applications**.

## üî¨ Key Concepts

* **Acoustic Streaming**
  A steady flow induced in a fluid due to the nonlinear interaction of acoustic waves and viscous effects. It plays a crucial role in microfluidic systems for applications like **cell sorting**, **mixing**, and **fluid transport**.

* **Boundary-Driven Streaming (Rayleigh Streaming)**
  A type of streaming that arises in systems with a **standing pressure field**, driven by shear forces in the viscous boundary layers near rigid walls.

* **Acoustic Radiation Force**
  A net force acting on microparticles in an acoustic field. Combined with **viscous drag**, it governs particle motion and positioning.
